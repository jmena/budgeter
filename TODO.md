# Tasks to be implemented
 
- Simulations based on tags (be able to create a simulation tag includes and excludes tags)
- Being able to break transactions.
- Cache simulation
- Make rules sortable (in the page that list rules)
- Classify rules by tags in the simulations (in the style of pivot tables)
