# Tasks to be implemented
 
- Simulations based on tags (be able to create a simulation tag includes and excludes tags)
- Being able to break transactions and bump then into the next period while recording the current value.
- Cache or store simulation. In case it takes long time.
- Make rules sortable (in the page that list rules)
- Classify rules by tags in the simulations (in the style of pivot tables) and make them sortable
- Copy rule or change rule type
- How to implement a period of last day of month?
- Three options to filter zero values:
  - no filter
  - filter all
  - filter non generated values
- Implement calculator


# DONE

- Use of 'inf' for number of periods. Transactions now have a limit of 4 years.
- Introduce the concept of projects. This is in preparation of advanced simulations concepts and sharing projects.
